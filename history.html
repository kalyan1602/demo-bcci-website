            <h1>Board of Control for Cricket in India</h1>
            <p>
                The <strong>Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)</strong> is the governing body for cricket in
                India. The board
                was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It
                is
                a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who
                in
                turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Grant Govan was its first
                president and Anthony De Mello its first secretary.

            <h1>Early years</h1>
            <p>
                In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, sponsored and captained by
                Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to
                attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor to the current International Cricket
                Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to
                attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to
                send a team to India, led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in
                the ICC if all the promoters of the game in the land came together to establish a single controlling
                body. An assurance was given and a meeting held in Delhi on 21 November 1927 and was attended by
                delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar,
                Central Provinces, Sindh and Punjab. A consensus was reached to create a board for control of cricket in
                India and on 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken. In
                December 1928, the BCCI was registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act with six
                associations affiliated to it. R E Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello
                as secretary. Indian cricket team toured England in 1932.

            <h1>Reforms: 2017 Committee of Administrators (CoA)</h1>
            <p>
                With the surge of cricket in India, BCCI has become rather notorious for its monopoly and has suffered
                from corruption allegations. The Supreme Court on 30 January 2017 nominated a four-member panel
                Committee of Administrators (Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikaram Limaye and Diana Edulji) to look after
                the administration of the BCCI in order to implement Lodha Committee reforms. Vinod Rai, ex-CAG of
                India heads the four members panel to look after the administrative duties of the board until the fresh
                elections are called. Presently Sourav Ganguly is the president of BCCI.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 9 August 2019, the BCCI agreed to adhere to the anti-doping mechanisms governed by the National
                Anti-Doping Agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sunil Joshi, former Indian cricket team spinner was named as Chairman of the national selection panel by
                the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of BCCI replacing MSK prasad in that role.
